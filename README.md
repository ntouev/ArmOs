# ArmOs
*__THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT. IF YOU WANT TO COLLABORATE PLEASE CONTACT ME.__*

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a **custom bootloader and a custom kernel** for **Cortex-A9** processors. Right now the only version is implemented in QEMU, and not in real hardware, so there are be some simplifications that should be considered, mentioned [here](#qemu).

## Prerequisites
Install __qemu-system-arm__ as an emulating machine with
```
$ sudo apt install qemu-system-arm
```
and a cross-compiler for compiling binaries for arm architectures.

I am using a custom made one with [crosstool-ng](https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng) and the [linaro](https://www.linaro.org/downloads/). You could choose either of them or another cross-compiler of your choice.

## Usage

* Download or clone the repository.

* In order to compile the project run
```
$ make
```

* To run the emulator with the custom bootloader and kernel run
```
$ make run
```
* To **debug** run
```
$ make debug
```
and then inside the gdb run
```
(qemu) target remote localhost:1234
```
You can also access [qemu monitor](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Monitor) typing:
```
$ telnet localhost 22223
```

* To disassembly the whole binary file (bootloader+kernel) run
```
$ make disassembly
```

## QEMU
##### Board
As mentioned above in the first stage of the development, ArmOs will be developed in QEMU. The exact program used is **qemu-system-arm** and the board is **vexprexx-a9**.

##### Running command
With **make run** the following code is running.
```
run:
	sudo qemu-system-arm\
	    -M vexpress-a9\        #specify board vexpress-a9
	    -m 512M\               #512 Mbyte of RAM (and ROM, see README.md)
	    -no-reboot\
	    -nographic\            #pass the uart0 in the terminal and close the pop up QEMU
	    -kernel kernel.bin\    #load kernel.bin as a Linux kernel (in 0x60010000)
		-monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:22223,server,nowait\
	    -S -s                  #toggle on and off for debugging and running mode accordingly
```
##### ROM emulation
Vexpress-a9 does not support the use of ROM memory so the trick to emulate such a functionality is to define 512 Mbyte of RAM (see above) and in the __linkscript to define the two sections of memory, one for refering as RAM and one as ROM__.
```linkscript
MEMORY
{
    ROM (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x60010000, LENGTH = 1M
    RAM (rwx): ORIGIN = 0x70000000, LENGTH = 32M
}
```

##### QEMU Vs Real hardware

Qemu, by default, uses a stub code in the beginning of the RAM at 0x60000000 (see Memory Map in [ARM CoreTile Express A9Ã—4  TRF](https://developer.arm.com/docs/dui0448/latest/preface)) as a BIOS to do some initialization and to jump to address 0x60010000 where the kernel of the Os should be. This is implemented because QEMU assumes that there will be a Linux kernel and there is where we put our custom **bootloader+kernel** file, **kernel.bin**. This is the reason that in file **linkscript.ld** we link the virtual ROM in 0x60010000.

This of course is something that in real hardware would not happen. In fact, in real situations, the above linkscript would link the bootloader in the start of the ROM or somewhere else if the system had a BIOS. Inserting the custom kernel as a Linux kernel is something we do for simplification in emulation and should be considered when the implementation is done for a real system.

This is also the reason that ROM starts from 0x60010000 and not from 0x60000000. If done otherwise QEMU would start its own BIOS in 0x60000000 and after some commands it would jump in address 0x60010000 where it would find nothing.

Below we can see in the first bytes of the RAM the stub code.
```
(qemu) xp /10w 0x60000000
0000000060000000: 0xe3a00000 0xe59f1004 0xe59f2004 0xe59ff004
0000000060000010: 0x000008e0 0x60000100 0x60010000 0x00000000
0000000060000020: 0x00000000 0x00000000

```
And this is the memory (ROM) where kernel.bin is mapped:
```
